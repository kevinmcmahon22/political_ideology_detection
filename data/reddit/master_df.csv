My mother has very little time on her hands, but she is very interested in the Democratic debates. To save her some time, I watched through both nights of debating and marked down every single question posed by the moderator and to whom it was addressed so she can skip just to the questions she cares about. She said I should share this with you.

**TL;DR This is a collection of time-stamps correlated with the NBC streams as found on YouTube (links below). I have transcribed and/or summarized the questions as best I could. If a line starts with ""to Candidate"", that indicates the moderator is asking a specific question to a candidate. Topics with no explicit question attached are marked ""on Issue"". If you are interested in a specific candidate or topic, use Ctrl+F and choose ""highlight all"".**

[---Timestamps for DNC Debate 1, June 26---](https://youtu.be/vJ6MrDO0kgY)

00:02:25 to Elizabeth Warren - You are planning [significant changes]. 71% Americans say the economy is doing well. What do you say to those who worry this significant change could be risky for the economy?

00:03:50 to Amy Klobuchar - You've called programs like free college something you might do if you were ""a magic genie."" Are the government programs and benefits your rivals are offering giving people a false sense of what's actually achievable?

00:05:20 to Beto O'Rourke - Some Democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of 70% on the very highest earners. Would you support that? If not, what would your top individual rate be?

00:07:15 to Cory Booker - You said we should not ""be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process."" Why do you disagree?

00:09:30 to Elizabeth Warren - Are you picking winners and losers?

00:10:35 to Julián Castro - What would you do to ensure women are being paid fairly in this country?

00:11:40 to Tulsi Gabbard - Same question. Your thoughts on equal pay?

00:12:50 to Bill DeBlasio - How would you address income inequality?

00:14:10 to John DeLaney - Do you agree [with DeBlasio]?

00:15:20 to Jay Inslee - How would you address income inequality?

00:16:25 to Tim Ryan - Trump promised that manufacturing jobs are coming back. Can you make that same promise?

00:17:45 to Elizabeth Warren - Are these jobs coming back?

00:19:00 show of hands - Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan?

00:19:20 to Amy Klobuchar - Why is an incremental approach [to healthcare] in your view better than a sweeping overhaul?

00:20:40 to Elizabeth Warren - You signed up to Sanders' Medicare-for-All plan. Is that the path you would pursue as president?

00:22:00 to Beto O'Rourke - You also praised the bill that would replace private insurance. This year you're saying you're no longer sure. Could you explain why?

00:25:05 to Tulsi Gabbard - Weigh in [on Medicare-for-All].

00:26:05 to Cory Booker - This [healthcare reform] is extremely important to people. Tell us where you are.

00:27:20 Elizabeth Warren - on healthcare

00:27:50 Jay Inslee - on healthcare

00:28:35 Amy Klobuchar - on womens' right to choose &amp; healthcare

00:29:15 to Julián Castro - Would your plan cover abortion?

00:30:20 to Elizabeth Warren - Would you put any limits on abortion?

00:31:10 to Cory Booker - Should pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs [opioids] be held criminally liable for what they do?

00:32:05 to Beto O'Rourke - How would you deal with it [the opioid crisis]?

00:33:35 to Julián Castro - If you were president today, what would you specifically do [about immigration]?

00:35:50 to Cory Booker - What would you do as president on day 1 [about immigration]?

00:37:05 Julián Castro - on immigration

00:37:50 Cory Booker - on immigration

00:38:05 Bill DeBlasio - on immigration

00:39:20 to Beto O'Rourke - What would you do day 1 at the white house [about immigration]?

00:40:40 Julián Castro, Beto O'Rourke, John DeLaney - on immigration

00:42:40 to Amy Klobuchar - Secretary Castro wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border. Do you support that? Should it be a civil offense only, and if so, do you worry about potentially incentivising people to come here?

00:44:15 to Tim Ryan - Should it be the crime to illegally cross the border or should it be a civil offense only?

00:45:30 to Cory Booker - What will you do day 1 [on immigration]?

00:46:55 to Jay Inslee - What will you do day 1 [on immigration]?

00:48:20 show of hands - Who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal [with Iran] as it was originally negotiated?

00:48:45 to Cory Booker - Why wouldn't you?

00:49:30 to Amy Klobuchar - Can you argue that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal?

00:50:50 to Tulsi Gabbard - You said you would sign on to the 2015 deal. Would you insist though that it addressed Iran's support for Hezbollah?

00:56:35 to Elizabeth Warren - Many of you were inspired [by teen activism] to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns including an assault weapons ban. What do you do about the millions of guns already out there, and does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it?

00:59:00 to Cory Booker - You have a federal government [gun] buyback program in your plan. How is that going to work?

01:00:15 to Julián Castro - Is this [gun violence in schools] a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes, or is something you would do as president that you think would turn it around?

01:01:55 Tim Ryan - on gun violence in schools

01:02:40 to Beto O'Rourke - What do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else but says 'You know what, the Democrats if I vote for them are going to take my gun away.' How do you have that conversation?

01:04:15 to Amy Klobuchar - Gun confiscation. If the government is buying back, how do you have that conversation?

01:05:10 to Cory Booker - Having served with Republicans on the judiciary committee, do you believe they would confirm your nominees [for supreme court]?

01:06:40 to Bill DeBlasio - If you nominate a Supreme Court nominee as president of the US and Mitch McConnell is still Senate Majority Leadaer, what makes you believe he would allow you to make a nominee?

01:08:30 to Elizabeth Warren - Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell if you don't beat him in the senate, if he's still sitting there as Senate Majority Leader?

01:10:05 to John DeLaney - Mitch McConnell doesn't operate that way [bipartisan]. He operates differently. Why do you think he's going to conform to your style?

01:11:20 to Cory Booker - Is President Booker going to get his bills on the floor with Senator McConnell?

01:12:25 to Jay Inslee - Let's get specific. We're here in Miami, which is already experiencing severe flooding on sunny days as a result of to sea level rise. Parts of Miami Beach and The Keys could be underwater in our lifetimes. Does your [climate change] plan save Miami?

01:14:00 to Beto O'Rourke - What's your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you're trying to do, but suddenly feels as if government's telling them how to live and ordering them how to live. What is that balance like?

01:15:50 to Julián Castro - Who pays for the mitigation to climate for people who are perhaps living in places that they shouldn't be living. Is this a federal government issue that needs to do that? Do they have to move these people? Maybe they're building a house some place that isn't safe. Who pays to build that house and how much should the government be bailing them out?

01:17:05 to Tim Ryan - A lot of the climate plans include pricing/taxing carbon in some way. If pricing carbon is politically impossible, how do we pay for climate mitigation?

01:19:00 John DeLaney - on climate change

01:19:45 to Tulsi Gabbard - One of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the LGBTQ community about your past stances on gay rights. After the Trump administartion's rollbacks of civil rights protections for many in that community, why should voters in that community trust you now?

01:21:10 Cory Booker - on LGBTQ issues

01:21:50 to Amy Klobuchar - What have you done for black and latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you are your party's nominee?

01:23:40 to Julián Castro - Is an economic justice agenda enough to mobilise latino voters to stand with the Democratic party?

01:24:40 to Beto O'Rourke - Does the US have a responsibility to protect in the case of genocide or crimes against humanity? Do we have a responsibility to intervene and protect people threatened by their governments even when their atrocities don't affect American core interests?

01:26:20 Bill DeBlasio - on interventionalism and war without congressional approval

01:27:20 to Tim Ryan - Leaders as disparate as President Obama and President Trump have both said they want to end US involvement in Afghanistan, but it isn't over for America. Why isn't it over? Why can't presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there, and how could you?

01:28:50 Tulsi Gabbard - on the war in Afghanistan

01:29:40 Tim Ryan - on the war in Afghanistan

01:30:10 Tim Ryan &amp; Tulsi Gabbard - on the war in Afghanistan

01:31:05 to all - What is the greatest geopolitical threat to the US?

01:32:35 to Beto O'Rourke - If the House chooses not to impeach [Donald Trump], as president would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller's report?

01:34:10 to John DeLaney - No US president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office. Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?

01:36:00 Amy Klobuchar - on Russian interference in US elections

01:37:00 Closing Statements

01:37:10 John DeLaney

01:38:15 Bill DeBlasio

[---Timestamps for DNC Debate 2, June 27---](https://youtu.be/cX7hni-zGD8)

00:02:20 to Bernie Sanders - Will taxes go up for the middle class in a Sanders Administration?

00:04:20 to Joe Biden - ""Nobody has to be punished, nobody's standard of living will change, nothing will change."" What did you mean by that?

00:05:55 to Kamala Harris - Do you think Democrats have a responsibility to explain how they will pay for every proposal?

00:07:14 to John Hickenlooper - You've warned that Democrats will lose in 2020 if they embrace socialism. What are the policies and positions of your opponents veering toward socialism?

00:08:44 to Bernie Sanders - What is your response to those who say nominating a socialist would reelect Donald Trump?

00:09:40 Kirsten Gillibrand - on income inequality/greed

00:10:26 to Michael Bennett - You have said ""It's possible to write policy proposals that have no basis in reality. You might as well call them candy."" Were you referring to any candidate or proposal in particular?

00:11:55 Kirsten Gillibrand - on Medicare for All

00:12:25 Pete Buttigieg - Many of your colleagues on stage support free college. You do not. Why not?

00:13:30 Eric Swalwell - on college affordability

00:13:55 to Andrew Yang - Your signature policy is to give every adult in the US $1000 a month, no questions asked. How would you do that?

00:15:50 to Eric Swalwell - Many Americans are worried that things like self-driving cars, robots, drones, AI will cost them their jobs. What would you do to help people get the skills they need to adapt to this new world?

00:16:35 Eric Swalwell and Joe Biden - pass the torch

00:18:20 Eric Slalwell, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris - on inequality

00:19:05 Kamala Harris - on inequality

00:20:20 show of hands - Who here would abolish private health insurance in favor of a government run plan?

00:20:45 to Kirsten Gillibrand - on health insurance/Medicare-for-all

00:21:55 to Pete Buttigieg - on health insurance/Medicare-for-all

00:23:10 to Joe Biden - You were one of the architects of Obamacare, so where do we go from here?

00:24:30 to Bernie Sanders - You basically want to scrap the private health insurance system as we know it and replace it with a government-run plan. None of the states that have tried something like that have been successful. If politicians can't make it work in those states, how do you implement it on a national level?

00:26:35 to Marianne Williamson - How would you lower the cost of prescription drugs?

00:28:00 to Michael Bennet - You want to keep this system we have in place. Is that enough to get us to universal coverage?

00:29:35 to Bernie Sanders - Your response?

00:31:30 show of hands - Would your government run plan provide coverage for undocumented immigrants?

00:31:45 to Pete Buttigieg - Why [did you say yes]?

00:33:00 to Joe Biden - [Undocumented immigrants] would be covered under your [healthcare] plan, which is different from Obamacare. Could you explain that change?

00:35:10 to Kamala Harris - On January 20, 2021, if you are president, what specifically would you do with the thousands of people who try to reach the US every day and want a better life through asylum.

00:37:25 to John Hickenlooper - What do you do, day 1 hour 1 [as president, about immigration]?

00:41:25 show of hands - Should it be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross the border without documentation?

00:45:10 Bernie Sanders - on immigration

00:46:50 to Kamala Harris - on immigration

00:48:25 to Michael Bennet - We asked last night to name the greatest geopolitical threat to the US. Four of them mentioned China. How would you stand up to China?

00:50:20 to Andrew Yang - You've expressed a lot of concerns about technology and taking jobs. Are you worried about China, and if so, how would you stand up against it?

00:51:15 to Pete Buttigieg - How would you stand up against China?

00:54:10 to Pete Buttigieg - In the last 5 years civil rights activists in our country have led a national debate over race and the criminal justice system. Your community of South Bend, Indiana has recently been in uproar over an officer-involved shooting. The police force in South Bend is now 6% black in a city that is 26% black. Why has that not improved in your two terms as mayor? 

00:55:55 John Hickenlooper - on police accountability

00:59:40 to Joe Biden - on race issues

01:00:55 Kamala Harris - Joe Biden, do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose bussing in America?

01:02:15 to Bernie Sanders - You said on the day you launched your campaign that ""voters should focus on what people stand for, not a candidate's race or age or sexual orientation"". Are you telling Democratic voters that diversity shouldn't matter when they're making this decision?

01:03:40 to Kirsten Gillibrand - Please weigh in on this.

01:04:30 to Michael Bennet - Should voters believe that somehow if there is a Democratic president in 2021 that [congressional] gridlock is going to magically disappear?

01:06:10 to Joe Biden - It does sound as if you haven't seen what's been happening in the US Senate over the last 12 years. It didn't happen. Why?

01:07:05 Michael Bennet - on bipartisanship and gridlock

01:07:40 Kirsten Gillibrand - on corruption in Washington and elections

01:08:35 to Bernie Sanders - What is your plan if Roe v. Wade is struck down in the court while you're president?

01:10:40 Kirsten Gillibrand - on abortion/reproductive rights

01:12:10 to Kamala Harris - Last night voters heard many of the candidates weigh in on their [climate change] proposals. Explain explicity what yours is.

01:14:00 to Pete Buttigieg - In your climate plan, if you are elected president, in your first term, how is this going to help farmers impacted by climate change in the midwest?

01:15:25 to John Hickenlooper - Can oil and gas companies be real partners in this fight?

01:17:00 to Joe Biden - Are there significant ways you can cut carbon emissions if you have to do it with no support from Congress?

01:18:25 Bernie Sanders - on climate change

01:19:05 Eric Slalwell - pass the torch

01:19:20 Marianne Williamson - on climate change

01:20:20 to all - In a few words what is the first issue you're going to push as president?

01:24:05 to Eric Slalwell - You are proposing that the government should buy back every assault weapon in America and it should be mandatory. How do you envision that working, especially in states where gun rights are a strong flash point?

01:25:30 to Bernie Sanders - You said ""my own view on guns is, everything being equal, states should make those decisions."" Has your thinking changed since then?

01:27:00 to Kamala Harris - on gun control

01:28:00 to Pete Buttigieg - Do you believe that military families or America's veterans at large have a different take on this [gun control] than the other Americans we have talking about and who Congressman Slalwell is talking about with his buyback program?

01:29:20 to Joe Biden - on gun control

01:30:15 to Michael Bennet - What do you see as important early steps in reversing the damage done [by the Trump administration]?

01:31:50 to all - What is the first [international] relationship you'd like to reset as President of the US?

01:33:55 to Joe Biden - You voted for the Iraq war, you have since said you regret that vote. Why should voters trust your judgment when it comes to making a decision about taking the country to war the next time?

01:35:25 to Bernie Sanders - on war abroad

Rows of troops. Tanks. Helicopters and fighter jets. A speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, with the front rows reserved for VIPs -- meaning the Republican elite and the president’s political donors.

Nothing about Trump’s 4th of July “Salute to America” says “We the People.”

President Trump has hijacked a national holiday and turned it into an indulgent, vain tribute to himself that eerily resembles the militaristic displays of repressive regimes around the world.

When you hold a national rally, where the great leader is flanked by the military and everyone not a member of the party in power is confined to the sidelines, that's not a salute to America. That's a reenactment of Nuremberg.

Instruments of war are not toys. The members of the military are not political props.

Instead of honoring the values at the foundation of this country -- freedom, tolerance, and respect for all -- Trump is only looking to boost his own ego.

A teacher of mine has a powerful idea. I want his words to become actions so I’m putting them out here. 

“Here is what I want:

I want all 24 Democratic candidates for President to convene a joint press conference outside the worst of the facilities where toddlers are being held in their own filth with no blankets, no beds, no soap, no showers. I want all the candidates, with no exceptions, to demand the doors be opened. I want them to demand a tour.

I would like the candidates to show up with people from the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders and UNICEF. I want the candidates to personally render aid to the children -- on camera. At the very least, I want it on camera when officials refuse entry to a federal facility by senators, congress people, governors and the national press. I want to see the guards showing their guns to block them.

I want this planned carefully. I want it publicized before, during and after. I want Fox News shamed into being there, then I want Fox News shamed into showing it. I want the candidates to agree to stand together, unified, and be prepared to stay for hours. I want them to only grant interviews in teams and I want them to keep on topic. I want no self promoting words from anyone. I want them to allow their actions to speak.

I want the DNC to set up everything necessary for a rally -- refreshments, stands, shelter -- and make sure this event is open to the public and well publicized beforehand. I want to see everyone unified in naming this part of the USA's new Concentration Camp system. No equivocating. I don't want any more lip service to outrage -- I want us to SEE the outrage in such a way that anyone who is turning a blind eye to the outrage can no longer deny its existence.

The logistics for this would be hard, but you cannot convince me it cannot be done, if there really is a will to save these children, there is a way.
Would that be blatantly using children for political props? Maybe, but it would definitely be an attempt to rescue children who are already being used as political props.

I want someone to do something for those babies. Now.”",1

I’m a conservative,I’m probably leaning republican but I believe everyone deserves to be heard and coming together is how we make solutions.I hate Trump ,he lacks intelligence,he is not relatable he would rather break other people down than build himself up .He is just really not fit to be president.

So I’m hoping that someone like Bernie who has strong ideas and really seems to care about the people or Biden who is actually kind of conservative will win.But I honestly don’t care very much who wins as long as they defeat Donald trump ,because Donald trump is not helping me get anywhere in life or making my life any easier ,he’s causing people to clash and complain and hate each other .To be blunt,that shit is getting really old.

So like I said I don’t care who wins Corey Booker,Beto,Elizabeth Warren ,it doesn’t matter to me who I just want trump out of office because he is toxic ,and everything surrounding him is toxic in search of power.He is single handedly ruining americas democracy.

But here’s what I want you guys to know as a Republican,my freinds who are more conservative than me one who is a bit extreme I would say,have been laughing at the Democratic Party lately .Why?Because it’s  like Deja Vu .Its like Hillary and Bernie tearing each other down on stage causing people to be split and I feel like that ruined the Democrats being in office right now because quite frankly as sad as this reality is :no woman is beating Donald trump.

That’s not me being a hater or sexist.Its being understanding of the political climate of America.Think about it ,there were probably large amounts of men who went out to vote trump just so Hillary wasn’t president.Its sad but it’s true.Its reality, a woman president just gave Trump another platform to fire up another group of people who would fuel his voting.Because that’s really all trump cares about ,getting votes ,so he wins so that he is in Power.

Don’t let what I said stop you from going out and voting a woman if you blew her to be the best candidate don’t let that stop you young ladies from the dream of becoming the first woman president ever .The point I’m trying to make is that it is nearly impossible because of trumps media techniques for a woman to beat him.But this a free country that was built on doing the “impossible” so vote for women and women should look into politics if that’s what they want to do.

That being said this is the main issue right now,and why my freinds are laughing and in no fear of trump not being re elected.The Democratic debates have been good.but kamala harris is killing us people trying to see trump out office.What the fuck is she doing?She is making a non issue out of a very minsicule subject that really means nothing,yes I am aware of the connotation, no I do not think joe Biden is dumb enough or shallow enough to make a purposefully racially motivated derogatory term.I know the media wants to make a big deal out of this but let me put things in perspective I am a mixed ,a Hispanic - American ,when I grew up the majority of my freinds and peers in general were black.Growing up I would call my freinds “my boys” or my boy.no one batted an eye and it was met back with a mutual response.So I don’t want to hear about that fake outrage shit.

Enough of that though .Kamala Harris needs to be quickly eliminated from the dems political picture,because she’s cashing a stir for her own campaign and publicity that puts others running against her in a bad position.Sound familiar?Because to me that sounds like Donald trump .Right now it looks like Joe Biden has the best chance of beating trump to me.Lets not dilly dally I’m fake outrage and sweet nothings ,let’s awaken ourselves to the reality that if we want trump out of office ,that all of us ..ALL OF US NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND BACK THE MOST LIKELY PERSON TO GET TRUMP OUT.whether that’s Elizabeth Warren,Bernie,Booker,Beto.But the REALITY is that it’s probably Biden with the best chance so wake up get your head on straight don’t fall victim to the media and let’s come together and do what we can to make sure we are all on the same page as to who we need to vote for come time to vote .

The answer?Not who you like,but who can take down trump.

If you don’t do that,then don’t complain about trump.

I’ll be voting for the most popular democratic candidate come 2020",1

t3_c60m7g,129,"I’ve been super interested in politics for a few years and this is the first election I can vote in. Here’s some of my thoughts..
First of all I don’t really have an outlet to talk about politics; my friends aren’t too interested in it and it’s a subject I try very hard to keep away from my family because they believe I’m too young to understand it. Hopefully this can be a way for me to let some ideas out :)

I really wish I would have heard more from Klobuchar tonight!! She was making some really great points, advocating good policies, and is a person that I think is refreshing to see on stage. I know it’s not her fault that she might not have gotten as much speaking time, but it would have been nice to hear her ideas on some more issues.

Speaking of candidates I wish I heard more from, I was surprisingly underwhelmed by Elizabeth Warren! I expected to hear a lot more from her considering her place in the polls and I feel like a lot of other people may have been unimpressed by her tonight.

I used to like Beto BEFORE he was running for president, I thought he had enough energy from the people and the fresh face needed to propel himself to a high position in the polls. Lately though, he seems to just be pandering and only addressing the same topics. For example, I’m sure most people can agree with me that it was weird when he started speaking spanish at random points. He was also definitely caught off guard by Julian Castro when they were being asked about the legality of undocumented border crossings.

Tim Ryan, Jay Inslee, and John Delaney don’t seem to be progressing forward in this election in my opinion. I had only heard of Delaney before tonight but didn’t really know any of policies, the other two didn’t impress that much.

I can’t wait to watch the debate tomorrow night! Poor Bernie has been in politics for so long and I don’t feel like he has the steamroller personality needed to beat Trump in this election. I’m really interested to see what the response will be to what Yang has to say, not enough people are taking the future of automated jobs into consideration.

The problem with dems in this race is that we need to find our own Trump; someone who can ignite passion in their followers and get more people involved in politics. The hardest thing to do this time around will be to take down someone who has mustered up a seemingly enormous group of people who blindly follow a disgraced leader. We still have tomorrows debate to watch, but we really need someone to take charge and show America that they have the ability to govern our country and handle the issues that our citizens really care about.",1

And it got me to thinking, is there any chance we here on Reddit could do a Toys for Tots kind of thing for the kids in these facilities? I was thinking, cuddly toys and dolls could be something for the little ones to hug. Something else for the older kids. Is there any chance of being able to get stuff to them?  

I know this is the least of their problems, but it could maybe provide a tiny bit of comfort and light. Is this just stupid?  

Update: It seems like there is no way to donate any supplies directly to the migrant kids and families in detention centers at this moment. Donations are being turned away in Clint, TX. However, approaches have been made, and with all the bad publicity this week, maybe the current stance will be relaxed.  

In the meantime, I put together a short list of links to organizations that are providing relief services at or near the border. Some of the links are to articles that have their own lists of organizations and charities doing this work.

The most successful strategies, enabled by the Citizens United decision, involve gaslighting and misinformation campaigns . These attacks are designed to divide and demoralize democratic voters to suppress participation in key battlegrounds. They are effective. I'm not optimistic that this administration (both in the white house or on Capital Hill) will accomplish much in the way of defending against these attacks.

I propose that *prior to the conclusion of the primary*, the candidates coalesce and form an *administration* \- identify specific roles proposed for specific candidates, incorporating, according to the strengths of each individual, as many of the top candidates as possible. Many of these roles will require senate confirmation; some may not. But I would hope that this would provide cohesion to the party and strengthen the surrogacy of the un-nominated while out on the campaign trail.

t3_c2ibp9,38,"A Different Way to look at Health Care
I am a big time liberal, I loved Obama, and I enjoy Bernie, but if you think giving Americans free health care will lower costs for everyone you dont understand the Health Care System. Before, I continue my father is a health care executive, so I definitely have a horse in this race. However, American Sickness (the NYT says it solves Health Care) cited his idea as a main avenue to providing cost efficient health care to the masses. In other words, my dad runs a giant public health care fund, where knee replacements are the highest cost (I will get back to that later), so he capped how expensive the knee replacements could be (which means instead of going to the most expensive knee doctor, patients decide between cheaper options saving money for both the insurers and those insured). So, to say that I am the spawn of Satan who makes his living off sick old grannies is a little bit of an overstatement. The problem with American Health Care is not necessarily the system but the culture. We are the world wide leader in medical research (we produce more research than the rest of the world combined), Cuba has the best socialist health care system (or at least a really good one) and they buy all of our old stuff. This is obviously due to systems we have in place to fast track medical research. Although that in its self has helped create the opioid crisis, it was set up to fight the AIDs epidemic, and is more of a problem with oversight than with the system (also how's the AIDS epidemic going, because I just saw Magic Johnson quit his job on live TV, so that disease isnt a death sentence anymore). So, inevitably when leading the race for discovery, cost will be higher than average. Next, doctors visits are very short in America. We are the fast food culture, who invented the idea of a drive thru. So, we expect the same treatment from our doctors. Do you need a knee replacement and have the insurance, you can be in surgery within the next hour. While in countries like Canada, who has free health care, the waiting time for such minor (they are major but they are minor because it is not life or death) surgeries can be up to three months. The turn over rate in America, and the speed in which we expect service, literally implodes the cost of health care. But, it seems like nobody will acknowledged said fact. Finally, as a collective Americans are extremely unhealthy. We are laughed at around the world for being fat and stupid. However, America's obesity problem quickly becomes a problem for the entire system. Knee replacements which are make up for a ton of the costs within health care (the costs have tripled since 93), are basically because we a so fucking fat. Being this fat, makes health care not only impossible but extremely expensive (it is also your body so you will want top of the line service if you have insurance even if you cant necessarily pay for said service). To summarize, as Americans we are fat so our health care cost go up, we also like our service quickly which makes costs go up, and finally we are doing the most research and development which inevitably implodes the cost. So, basically our own culture literally makes health care even more expensive that it already would be in a diverse country of 300 million. So, in my mind the first thing we need to do to change health care is change America's culture (and maybe make a law that would mandate everyone had insurance, and instead of setting up a place to buy said insurance Obama Care, maybe do a car insurance thing where there are levels but whatever). This isnt a very insightful thing to say, or very proactive, so that's why I believe no politicians discuss the underlying principles that make our costs so high. I just think people dont understand or not aware of the other side of the argument. My dad is a good dude, who wants to give you cheep and affordable health care. I mean he voted for Obama both times, even though it could destroy his industry. Not because he is a liberal cheese ball, but because he does believe in the ideals of free health care. He just thinks there are underlying cultural problems that nobody is addressing.  P.S. Sorry if I sound like a whiny rich kid, I just hear this argument every time Im home, and wanted to share it with the masses",1

So, it's no surprise that Donald Trump is inspiring a lot of novice first time and second time voters to get registered and get to the polls to cast a ballot against him.  We welcome you all to the good fight, thanks for showing up!

But...whenever we get brand new voters, we get brand new people that know nothing about politics beyond School House Rock.  This leads to a lot of bad feelings where people feel like they are being cheated because they didn't realize that they had to actually register to vote.  Or that Democrats use a system of Super Delegates.  Or that something called the Electoral College exists.

So, while I encourage everyone reading this to google their states rules on registering and voting in the primaries/caucuses, and registering and voting in the general...instead I want to talk to people about how the Democratic Primaries work when we have such a large field of Candidates.

Namely: 

#VIABILITY THRESHOLDS

*What is it?* ::  A Viability threshold is the minimum percentage of the vote count a candidate must receive before they will be awarded any delegates for that state's primary/caucus.  Every state is allowed to set their Viability Threshold wherever they want, but most states use a 15% benchmark (Including the first 4 Primary/caucus states of IA, NH, NV, and SC).  

*What does that mean?* :: That means that for a candidate to receive delegates in any state's contest, they must get at least 15% of the vote at the state or congressional district level.  At that point, delegates are awarded proportionally.  If a candidate does not meet the viability threshold, they DO NOT receive any delegates.  Any proportional delegates that a candidate would have received are then free to pledge their support for any VIABLE candidate.  If NO candidate is viable, the state level board would need to make a call, but that situation has not occurred before that I know of, and is unlikely to occur in 2020.

*Wait?  So my candidate might not get any delegates?* :: It's very possible.  Let's look at a few practical examples Below

[The most recent poll done for the state of Iowa](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m3FrMzNqO5Sm5SVnVXZHBkOVpPQXpXX0pPWF9YSHhVb1g0/view) shows Joe Biden receiving 30% of the vote, Bernie Sanders receiving 22% of the vote, and no other candidate crossing the viability threshold of 15% (although Warren and Buttigeig come close).  

If all things remained equal, and no one drops out, then if Iowa were held today, Joe Biden would receive about 30% of Iowa's 41 delegates, Bernie would get about 22% of Iowa's delegates, and the remaining 48% would be ""At - Large"" and would have to switch their support to Biden or Bernie.  No other candidate would receive delegates.  

Now, let's say Warren came in a strong 3rd in Iowa with 14% of the vote, she could definitely campaign off that.  She could claim momentum.  But she could not claim delegates.


Let's take another example.

[The latest Polling in Nevada](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nv_061219.pdf/) Shows Joe Biden getting 36% of the vote, Elizabeth Warren getting 19% of the vote..and no other candidate reaching viability.  That means if the Nevada Caucus were held today, then all 36 Nevada Delegates would be split between Biden and Warren.  No other candidate would receive delegates.

#SO WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN, WHY ARE YOU TELLING US THIS?

I don't want a repeat of 2016...where a mechanism like super delegates, which had existed for roughly 42 years at that point, to suddenly be portrayed as the boogeyman and a method of ""rigging"" the primary.  

I have also heard MANY MANY MANY redditors who support certain candidates insisting ""It doesn't matter what the polling says, my candidate doesn't need to win the primaries, they can go into the convention with a *plurality* of votes and everyone will switch to them because they will see how awesome s/he is"".

Viability Thresholds are necessary to make sure that a clown car full of candidates (24 at last count) who are not seriously running don't clear the field for some crazy person to take our nomination, a la Trump.  They are not mysterious.  They are not sinister.  They are not new. The DNC did not invent them in 2020 to keep your candidate down.  

You need to understand going in that having THIS many candidates vying for the nomination means that some of them will have low vote counts.  But if they cannot convince even 15% of DEMOCRATS TO VOTE FOR THEM, then how in  the hell can they beat a republican in a general election?  These vetting procedures are how we get STRONG candidates, and weed out weaker ones.  If your argument is ""The DNC is keeping my candidate down and cheating them!"" my answer is ""How in the hell can you say your candidate is viable when they can't get 15% of a vote from true believers in the party?""

#ALSO

Please understand that polls and numbers will change as we get closer to Iowa.  Candidates will drop out, their supporters will start supporting someone else.

But I hear a lot of people saying ""My candidate is only 20 points behind!  They can come back!"".  No.  No.  Your candidate is probably not able to come back.  Maybe they can!  But probably not.  

One of the reasons I am pointing this out is because currently [The most recent poll out of Florida](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/documents/monmouthpoll_nv_061219.pdf/) Shows that Joe Biden, with 41% of the vote, is the ONLY candidate that meets the Viability Threshold in that state, and if the Primary were held today, he would get all 214 delegates from Florida.  So far Biden is the only candidate meeting viability in a number of delegate heavy states.  

Iowa is 8 months away, anything can happen.  But I already see MULTIPLE reddit conspiracy theories about how Biden is ""rigging"" the election by being popular.  I don't want people to be blindsided by Viability Thresholds and think they are some evil establishment plot.  I will be posting this exact same thread multiple times between here and February, for all the good it will do.  If you support beating Trump, help spread the word, feel free to copy and paste my post...Just so we don't have a depressed Democratic turnout because well meaning, but uninformed, voters feel disenfranchised when their candidate gets 8% of a vote count, but no delegates.",1

t3_c2c083,55,"Behold Trumponomics seems like it ll build a new order.
Trumponomics opposes both international socialism and absolute free market capitalism, arguing that their views represent a third position. They claim to provide a realistic economic alternative that was neither laissez-faire capitalism nor communism. They favor corporatism and class collaboration, believing that the existence of inequality and social hierarchy was beneficial (contrary to the views of socialists), while also arguing that the state had a role in mediating relations between classes (contrary to the views of liberal capitalists)

An important aspect of Trumpism is economic dirigism, meaning an economy where the government often subsidizes favorable companies and exerts strong directive influence over investment, as opposed to having a merely regulatory role. In general, trumponomics is based on private property and private initiative, that  are contingent upon service to the state.

Trumponomics encourages the pursuit of private profit and offered many benefits to large businesses, but they demanded in return that all economic activity should serve the national interest.",1

t3_c1t56a,32,"State Legislative Elections 2019
Reminder: There are state legislative and gubernatorial elections occurring in 4 different states in 2019! If you're in one of these five states, this is big!

In New Jersey, there are elections for all 80 seats in the General Assembly, the lower chamber of the state legislature. The primary election just happened on June 4, and the general is November 5th. Dems currently hold a 54-26 advantage over Republicans. The registration deadline is 21 days prior to the vote, so October 14th.

In Mississippi, both chambers of the state legislature are holding elections. All 122 seats in the HoR, and all 52 seats in the Senate are up. Dems hold 45 to Republicans 74 in the House, with 3 other, and we are down 19 to 33 in the Senate. This is a very unlikely pickup opportunity, but we can certainly bring ourselves closer in both chambers with high turnout. The primary election is not until August 6th, and clerks must receive the registration documents by July 27th at the latest. For the general, registration is due October 26th.

Louisiana has the governorship up for grabs, as well both chambers, of which all seats are available. The Primary is on October 12, and the General election is November 16th. Registration is due September 11 in person or the 21st online. Voting for Bel Edwards is highly important, but trimming the 23 and 11 seat leads in the chambers would be a great accomplishment in addition.

Lastly, Virginia, our best pickup opportunity, where all seats are available. We are currently losing 49-51 in the House of Delegates, and 19-21 in the Senate. That means flipping two seats in both would give us a Democratic trifecta in the state. That's absolutely massive. The primary was just last Tuesday the 11th, and the General is November 5th. The registration deadline is October 15th. Make sure you register!

That's all for now, but keep these off-year elections on your radar.",1

t3_c0ok74,27,"2020 Best Senate Candidates
I've been thinking a lot about who would be the best Senate candidates to challenge Republican held seats or possibly primary incumbent Dems. I would love to hear your opinions on the matter!

Alabama: Jones is the man for the job, let's crush Roy Moore or (Tommy Tuberville wtf?).

Alaska: Ethan Berkowitz-I know next to nothing about Alaska, but I'm hesitant to want to see Begich be the nominee again, as he lost in 2014 and then lost in the 2018 Gubernatorial. If not Berkowitz, I have to imagine there's some other newer blood in the party who can challenge Sullivan.

Arizona: I love that Mark Kelly's running, I want more scientists in government. I think we saw the Arizona strategy in Sinema, and I think Kelly is moderate enough, although left of her, to take down McSally. She's also the 3rd least popular senator up for reelection in 2020 and was never elected, making her quite vulnerable.

Arkansas: Alright, Arkansas is not going to happen barring a miracle. But this will be the 40th year anniversary of the Miracle on Ice. Could we see history repeat itself with the US once again triumphing over Russia, this time in the presidential election? But Mike Beebe was an incredibly popular Democratic Governor, and might have the best chance in the state to at least make Cotton a bit nervous. He won't pull it off probably, but getting the GOP to put money into Arkansas would be quite glorious.

Colorado: This is probably our easiest seat to pick up. Gardner is barely more popular than McSally, and Colorado is moving from Purple to Blue pretty surely. I was personally most excited about Crisanta Duran, but she's running in the House, so i'm on the Dan Baer train. A former professor and diplomat, he's now the head of 

Colorado's Department for Higher Education. We need more teachers and people focused on education in Congress, and this is the guy. Mike Johnston is also a guy to watch out for.

Delaware: I'm happy, and more importantly the people of Delaware like Coons. Get him another term!

Georgia: It's gotta be Teresa Tomlinson. The ""deal"" was Stacey for Governor and her for Senate, and with Abrams not running (VP perhaps) Tomlinson has gotta be the one.

Idaho: I know nothing about Idaho, Idahoans please help!

Illinois: Dick's got one more term left in him and there's no one in the field who excites me to run against him. I think it's too early for Underwood to try for the Senate although I look forward to her in the future.

Iowa: Speaking of young women setting the world alight in Congress, i also think its too early for Abby Finkenauer, who will be 31, to run. 2022 for Grassley's seat is most ideal for her. Back to 2020 though, Rob Sand could be a good option, the State Auditor.

Kansas: Kansas is probably not a possible pickup on the national stage, but Barry Grissom looks a solid choice as an established Kansas face to take on Kobach or Colyer or whoever in the General.

Kentucky: Look, fuck McConnell first of all. I know people are on board the Amy McGrath train, but McGrath lost in a district that is less Republican than the state as a whole (by Cook PVI) and I'd rather she went after a seat in the House again. Aside from her perhaps Edelen runs now that he's not going for Gov, or Beshear does if he loses? Ashley Judd is a potential candidate apparently, so wouldn't that be weird.

Louisiana: MITCH, MITCH, MITCH. I thought he might consider a presidential run, but perhaps the Senate is more his style. Louisiana's a tough state to be a Dem, but Landrieu feels very genuine and real, and his record as Mayor of NO could make him a candidate, once again to at least push a deep red state. Some of these, it's about making the GOP work for it. No free seats.

Maine: Susan Collins should be toast. The Kavanaugh vote brought her duplicity to the forefront, and her opponent will have a sizeable warchest. I was on the Susan Rice train, but now I'm looking at Hannah Pingree, or perhaps Emily Cain or Cecile Richards. A huge advocate for pro-choice taking the seat from a ""pro-choice"" person like Collins would be poetic, although i'm not sure how feasible.

Michigan: According to MorningConsult, Gary Peters is the least popular Senator up for reelection. With a lot of national attention to be paid to the state, we need a really good candidate, and Peters isn't it. Unfortunately I don't know who is.

Minnesota: Tina get it done.

Mississippi: Another unlikely one, but I'd give Mike Espy, 2018 candidate, another chance. He did quite well against Cindy Hyde-Smith, and I think he could push her hard again this time.

Montana: I wanted Bullock to go for it, but in his absence, I think Michael Punke could make a good case. He's more than just the writer of the Revenant, but an advisor on trade and intellectual property law.

Nebraska: No Democratic members of Congress, I really have no idea who could run for this.

New Hampshire: Shaheen is very popular in her state, I think she can comfortably win reelection.

New Jersey: Booker is not a very likely Presidential nominee, so I think he'll be elected to another term.

New Mexico: Xochitl it's not quite your time. Ben Ray Lujan would make a solid candidate in another state that's nearly blue by now.

North Carolina: Jeff Jackson hasn't announced, but he fits a new group of young Democratic veterans who are running for office. He's solidly progressive but with a military pedigree, and would be a great choice to beat Tillis.

Oklahoma: Brad Henry is another popular Dem Governor who could push Inhofe here. Kendra Horn is an exciting choice, but I don't want her to be a sacrificial lamb.

Rhode Island: Jackkkkk REEED!

South Carolina: Another long shot, but Mandy Powers Norrell is a solid candidate to give Graham a run for his money.

South Dakota: Let's give Billie Sutton another chance, why not?

Tennessee:The Minority Leader of the Senate, Jeff Yarbro, could be a solid choice to run for the open seat here.

Texas: I'm going to be honest, Beto is my favorite candidate in the Democratic primary right now, and his town hall in particular delivered and dispelled the notion that he's all image no substance. However, he's falling behind in the race, and if he doesn't start to make his way back into the top 5 by around October or November, I think he needs to run for Senate. Cornyn is less hated than Cruz, but he also is less liked, he essentially just hides out. I want to take the fight to him. If Beto hopefully gains some ground, then look out for MJ Hegar or my sleeper, Colin Allred, to take Cornyn on.

Virginia: Warner is i believe the richest person in the Senate, which I don't love, but none of the people in Congress I like (Wexton, Spanberger) are going to do as well in the General I imagine.

West Virginia: Let's give JFK with tattoos, AKA Richard Ojeda a chance. There's no way Swearingen gets close to winning, environmental activists just can't win in that state right now. Let's give the veteran populist a chance.

Wyoming:I have no idea, just don't let Liz Cheney win please.
So some of these are clearly more educated than others, so i'd love to hear your thoughts and critiques. Who do you all think should be running for each of these seats, who would be the best candidate?",1

It's ridiculous. How do they call themselves patriots?",1
